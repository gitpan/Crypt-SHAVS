Scripts for Checking CPAN SHA Implementations
=============================================

The Perl scripts in this directory automate the checking of the following
CPAN modules:

	Digest::SHA
	Digest::SHA1
	Digest::SHA::PurePerl

They run as many tests as possible for each module.

To use them, first download and unzip the NIST test vectors by running
the setup script as follows:

	$ python setup-shavs.py

Then, to check the Digest::SHA implementation for example, type:

	$ perl digest-sha.pl

Note: the checks for Digest::SHA and Digest::SHA1 complete very quickly,
usually in well under 30 seconds.  However, an hour or more is required
for Digest::SHA::PurePerl, due largely to the Monte tests which require
100,000 digest computations each.
