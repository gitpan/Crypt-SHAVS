	- Original version
		-- regarded as initial prototype
		-- interface might change radically
	- Try using the most familiar output format
		-- based on "check" mode of md5sum/shasum
		-- minus the WARNINGs and summaries
	- Digest::SHA is not actually required for Crypt::SHAVS
		-- but it's currently the easiest way to test it
		-- this PREREQ will certainly change in the future
	- Object-oriented programming interface
		-- two methods only, to emphasize ease of use
