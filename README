Crypt-SHAVS version 0.02
========================

Crypt::SHAVS automates the checking of any SHA implementation by comparing
its behavior against the detailed test vectors of NIST's SHA Validation
System (SHAVS).  The capability extends to the testing of upcoming SHA-3
implementations as well, assuming the continued use of SHAVS by NIST.

See the "scripts" directory for programs that automate the checking of
various CPAN SHA implementations.
